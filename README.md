This repo contains the code for an analysis of two timeseries: Qi portfolio and SPX.

A comparison is made between the two, using statistical measures:
- Alpha
- Beta
- Information ratio
- Sharpe ratio
- Sortino Ratio
- Tracking error
- Volatility (ARMA-GARCH)

Predicitive relationships between the two portfolios were also explored, using a Granger causality test, and a vector autoregression model.
